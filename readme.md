Overview

A simple product configurator for table. 
Its a simple static Page, its currently not meant to be for any other model because it can have some issues with configurater.js. A change of materials might be required in configurator.js for any other model.

For making it more dynamic for any model we need to setup a json like structure where model can store its changable material/mesh info that can be fetched directly.
A CMP will also be needed to make more dynamic.
